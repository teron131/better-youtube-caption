      "He threatened to massively increase\n",
      "[0:15] tariffs on Chinese goods and says that\n",
      "China is becoming increasingly hostile.\n",
      "[0:20] When you and I met in January, you\n",

      "relationship between us and China was\n",
      "[0:27] going.\n",
      "Yeah, we.\n",
      "[0:29] Right?\n",
      "Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "[0:30] I mean, the reality is that our\n",
      "interests are relatively divergent at\n",
      "[0:35] this point.\n",
      "And that's particularly true when it\n",
      "[0:37] comes to semiconductors, when it comes\n",
      "to Taiwan.\n",
      "[0:40] And so.\n",
      "TRUMP You know, I think what he's doing\n",
      "[0:42] right now is, is he's putting the art of\n",
      "the deal.\n",
      "[0:46] He's trying to get the best deal that he\n",

      "[0:48] And I, I understand that he has to\n",
      "manage he has to manage this reality\n",
      "[0:53] that right now we are kind of dependent\n",
      "on China for a lot of things.\n",
      "[0:57] But, you know, I think what we talked\n",
      "about last time is this is why we need\n",
      "[1:01] to re industrialize.\n",
      "This is why we need to have our own rare\n",
      "[1:03] earth supplies, is why we need to be\n",
      "able to make our own chips and our own\n",
      "[1:06] computers and our own products\n",
      "downstream because it takes away\n",
      "[1:08] leverage from China.\n",
      "They do have a lot of leverage right\n",
      "[1:12] now, and so it's very hard to make deals\n",
      "with them.\n",
      "[1:15] I think it's actually healthy for the\n",
      "US-China relationship for it to not be\n",
      "[1:21] so dependent on China right now.\n",
      "We don't have great solutions to\n",
      "[1:25] quantify it.\n",
      "I mean, so you're so involved in Arsenal\n",

      "But right now, the weapons that Andrew\n",
      "[1:31] makes and the autonomous systems, how\n",

      "[1:36] at this moment on China?\n",
      "Andrew has done a uniquely good job of\n",
      "[1:39] getting away from China versus not just\n",
      "other defense companies, but also\n",
      "[1:43] compared to most American companies in\n",
      "general.\n",
      "[1:45] Remember that we are sanctioned by\n",
      "China.\n",
      "[1:48] Remember that our executives are\n",
      "personally sanctioned by China.\n",
      "[1:52] And so we have\n",
      "we can't we're not doing this for you to\n",
      "[1:56] leverage or negotiating reasons.\n",
      "We have to get off of Chinese supply\n",
      "[2:00] chain and not just things that are\n",
      "literally made in China, but even things\n",
      "[2:03] that are dependent on China.\n",
      "So it's dependent on Chinese precursor\n",
      "[2:07] chemicals or Chinese equipment or\n",
      "machinery or processing.\n",
      "[2:11] We have to make very aggressive moves to\n",
      "stay away from that and keep us and\n",
      "[2:16] allied supply chain to the absolute\n",
      "greatest extent possible.\n",
      "[2:19] So I would say Andrew is not even really\n",
      "what I'm concerned about.\n",
      "[2:23] It's the broader economy and maybe some\n",
      "other defense companies, if you can\n",
      "[2:27] believe it, there's lots of us defense\n",
      "companies that haven't been sanctioned\n",
      "[2:30] by China and therefore they haven't had\n",
      "the foresight to go and build it.\n",
      "[2:36] And as you are in Ohio, how is that\n",
      "going?\n",
      "[2:39] How is Arsenal managing to hit the\n",
      "milestones you want to see?\n",
      "[2:42] So Arsenal is not just important, but\n",
      "it's necessary.\n",
      "[2:45] So you guys know it's about 5 million\n",
      "square feet of manufacturing capacity\n",
      "[2:48] we're building in Ohio.\n",
      "We have to build it.\n",
      "[2:50] We have so much volume that we just have\n",
      "to output that we can't do it without\n",
      "[2:54] that new site.\n",
      "We started building that site many\n",
      "[2:58] months before the government gave us\n",
      "these contracts that we that are now\n",
      "[3:02] going to fulfill its capacity.\n",
      "And thank goodness we did like this\n",

      "[3:09] I'm sorry, as in non arsenal.\n",
      "What I'm saying not our non arsenal\n",
      "[3:14] production is up 400% and then so next\n",
      "year we expect to see an equally large\n",
      "[3:19] bump up and that is going to be critical\n",
      "for Arsenal to come online.\n",
      "[3:22] We actually already have the first round\n",
      "of employees who are going to be working\n",
      "[3:25] at Arsenal.\n",
      "We brought them from Ohio to HQ.\n",
      "[3:28] They're going to be here for the next\n",
      "six months.\n",
      "[3:31] I guess it's it's less than six months\n",
      "now.\n",
      "[3:32] They've been here for a while and that\n",
      "way they're able to get indoctrinated\n",
      "[3:36] and our processes work on our existing\n",
      "manufacturing systems.\n",
      "[3:39] And then when Arsenal one opens next\n",
      "year, they can go in and hit the ground\n",
      "[3:43] running.\n",
      "Day one.\n",
      "[3:44] What do you need from the Department of\n",

      "There is a recognition that we don't\n",

      "usual, that we need to move much faster,\n",
      "[3:58] that we need to be building new things\n",
      "and new ways that we need to design\n",
      "[4:01] weapons that can be manufactured by the\n",

      "[4:04] We have the talent base that we have.\n",

      "spades.\n",
      "[4:09] They're just working on the wrong\n",

      "[4:11] Most of our best talent, you know,\n",
      "contrast this with the Cold War, is no\n",
      "[4:14] longer working on national security\n",
      "problems, but is working on things like\n",
      "[4:17] advertising optimization, on new apps,\n",
      "on on tools of entertainment rather than\n",
      "[4:21] tools of deterrence.\n",
      "And I've seen that reversing.\n",
      "[4:24] There's a lot of people and I'm of all\n",
      "ages we're talking to people who've been\n",
      "[4:28] in the industry for 20, 30 years, all\n",
      "the way down to kids who are just going\n",
      "[4:31] into school, learning disciplines that\n",
      "are relevant to aerospace and defense.\n",
      "[4:35] I think that there's a lot of people who\n",
      "are realizing we've been resting on our\n",
      "[4:38] laurels and coasting for a couple of\n",
      "decades, and then our tech industry has\n",
      "[4:41] to get in gear and work on more\n",
      "important problems.\n",
      "[4:44] There was a report about the NGC two\n",
      "system it named both Android and\n",
      "[4:51] Palantir.\n",
      "We've asked Palantir through Shon to\n",

      "imbalances case move markets.\n",
      "[4:59] Could you just.\n",
      "Respond to that reporting which came\n",
      "[5:01] from Reuters and explain the sort of\n",
      "timeline and the inaccuracies that you\n",
      "[5:08] feel there are in that report.\n",
      "So you may or may not remember this, but\n",
      "[5:11] I was a journalism major myself.\n",
      "I was only a semester and a half away\n",
      "[5:15] from graduating.\n",
      "I was the online editor of the Daily 40\n",
      "[5:17] Niner, which was the Cal State Long\n",
      "Beach student run newspaper.\n",
      "[5:21] So I care a lot about this stuff, both\n",
      "as a internal perspective and then also\n",
      "[5:24] just from a journalist perspective.\n",
      "The journalist who wrote that Reuters\n",
      "[5:27] story would have been failed out of the\n",
      "class by any of my professors.\n",
      "[5:30] He refused to include our on the record\n",
      "statement.\n",
      "[5:33] He refused to include the on the record\n",
      "statement from the Army because they\n",
      "[5:35] fundamentally made the whole story, not\n",
      "a story.\n",
      "[5:39] There was an analysis saying, hey,\n",
      "there's all of these security problems\n",
      "[5:41] like the system, the prototype for NGC\n",
      "two next generation command control.\n",
      "[5:45] It's not tracking what the users are\n",
      "doing.\n",
      "[5:47] It doesn't have any passwords to log in.\n",
      "There's no security turned on.\n",
      "[5:51] And they said, oh, my God, this is a\n",
      "huge problem.\n",
      "[5:53] And we said, Guys, this was an early\n",
      "prototype.\n",
      "[5:55] The Army wasn't paying us to demonstrate\n",
      "user accounts.\n",
      "[5:58] It was paying us to demonstrate\n",
      "integration of different sensors,\n",
      "[6:01] different weapons systems all into one\n",
      "pipeline.\n",
      "[6:04] And Lattice has all this functionality.\n",
      "We do this all the time.\n",
      "[6:07] It's not like it's not like we don't\n",
      "know how to do this.\n",
      "[6:10] And the army said the same.\n",
      "They said, Yeah, we just turned on all\n",
      "[6:12] those features with just a few weeks\n",
      "later, all these issues that you're\n",
      "[6:15] talking about didn't exist.\n",
      "This was an internal security audit,\n",
      "[6:19] just noting that these things were a\n",
      "factor in that early prototype.\n",
      "[6:23] Yes.\n",
      "There's no access control.\n",
      "[6:25] Yes, that is a risk.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "[6:26] We have not audited all of their\n",
      "security, you know, all their security\n",
      "[6:29] code.\n",
      "That is a risk.\n",
      "[6:30] But that's completely normal for early,\n",
      "early development.\n",
      "[6:33] But Reuters didn't include our quote,\n",
      "didn't include the Army's quote, because\n",
      "[6:35] that would have made the entire story\n",
      "around it.\n",
      "[6:37] So instead, they include, quote,\n",
      "exclusively from our competitors and\n",
      "[6:40] from so-called anonymous sources saying\n",
      "that Android and Palantir are running\n",

      "[6:55] I'll get back into the journalism game.\n",
      "We can say pretty definitively we've\n",

      "that.\n",
      "[7:01] You absolutely have.\n",

      "[7:25] planted.\n",
      "There's a lot of people who are\n",
      "[7:26] competing.\n",

      "[7:30] I'm just not saying that.\n",
      "I didn't say that it is.\n",
      "[7:33] Look, these guys are still winning a lot\n",
      "of contracts.\n",
      "[7:36] The reality, whether we like it or not,\n",
      "is that these companies do have a lot of\n",

      "We don't want them to go out of\n",
      "[7:41] business.\n",

      "we're working with Lockheed, we're\n",
      "[7:48] working with Northrop.\n",
      "We're also competing with them for\n",
      "[7:50] programs.\n",
      "I think that in general, the industry\n",
      "[7:53] needs to move towards a model where\n",
      "companies invest more of their own money\n",
      "[7:56] in these products, where they fail that\n",
      "need they need to skin their own knees,\n",

      "[8:20] There are a lot of retail investors, a\n",
      "lot of institutional investors who want\n",

      "[8:35] question we get for you.\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "[8:37] It just is.\n",
      "So, look, we are we we are on a path to\n",
      "[8:42] IPO.\n",
      "Like like I can explicitly say that I'm\n",
      "[8:44] not going to be coy about that.\n",
      "We are running the company as if we are\n",

      "[9:10] No need to do any paperwork.\n",

      "[9:16] And we've gotten into that swing of\n",
      "things.\n",
      "[9:18] It's going to be it's going to be it's\n",
      "going to be in low single digit years.\n",

      "what you are trying to build.\n",
      "[9:28] Agreed.\n",
