      "[0:27] going.\n",
      "Yeah, we.\n",
      "[0:29] Right?\n",
      "Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "[0:30] I mean, the reality is that our\n",
      "interests are relatively divergent at\n",
      "[0:35] this point.\n",
      "And that's particularly true when it\n",
      "[0:37] comes to semiconductors, when it comes\n",

      "[0:40] And so.\n",
      "TRUMP You know, I think what he's doing\n",
      "[0:42] right now is, is he's putting the art of\n",

      "[0:46] He's trying to get the best deal that he\n",

      "[0:48] And I, I understand that he has to\n",

      "[0:53] that right now we are kind of dependent\n",
      "on China for a lot of things.\n",
      "[0:57] But, you know, I think what we talked\n",
      "about last time is this is why we need\n",
      "[1:01] to re industrialize.\n",
      "This is why we need to have our own rare\n",
      "[1:03] earth supplies, is why we need to be\n",

      "They do have a lot of leverage right\n",
      "[1:12] now, and so it's very hard to make deals\n",

      "[1:15] I think it's actually healthy for the\n",

      "[1:36] at this moment on China?\n",
      "Andrew has done a uniquely good job of\n",
      "[1:39] getting away from China versus not just\n",
      "other defense companies, but also\n",
      "[1:43] compared to most American companies in\n",
      "general.\n",
      "[1:45] Remember that we are sanctioned by\n",
      "China.\n",
      "[1:48] Remember that our executives are\n",
      "personally sanctioned by China.\n",
      "[1:52] And so we have\n",
      "we can't we're not doing this for you to\n",
      "[1:56] leverage or negotiating reasons.\n",
      "We have to get off of Chinese supply\n",

      "literally made in China, but even things\n",
      "[2:03] that are dependent on China.\n",
      "So it's dependent on Chinese precursor\n",
      "[2:07] chemicals or Chinese equipment or\n",
      "machinery or processing.\n",
      "[2:11] We have to make very aggressive moves to\n",
      "stay away from that and keep us and\n",
      "[2:16] allied supply chain to the absolute\n",
      "greatest extent possible.\n",
      "[2:19] So I would say Andrew is not even really\n",
      "what I'm concerned about.\n",
      "[2:23] It's the broader economy and maybe some\n",
      "other defense companies, if you can\n",
      "[2:27] believe it, there's lots of us defense\n",
      "companies that haven't been sanctioned\n",
      "[2:30] by China and therefore they haven't had\n",
      "the foresight to go and build it.\n",
      "[2:36] And as you are in Ohio, how is that\n",
      "going?\n",
      "[2:39] How is Arsenal managing to hit the\n",
      "milestones you want to see?\n",
      "[2:42] So Arsenal is not just important, but\n",
      "it's necessary.\n",
      "[2:45] So you guys know it's about 5 million\n",
      "square feet of manufacturing capacity\n",
      "[2:48] we're building in Ohio.\n",
      "We have to build it.\n",
      "[2:50] We have so much volume that we just have\n",

      "[2:54] that new site.\n",
      "We started building that site many\n",
      "[2:58] months before the government gave us\n",
      "these contracts that we that are now\n",
      "[3:02] going to fulfill its capacity.\n",

      "What I'm saying not our non arsenal\n",
      "[3:14] production is up 400% and then so next\n",
      "year we expect to see an equally large\n",
      "[3:19] bump up and that is going to be critical\n",
      "for Arsenal to come online.\n",
      "[3:22] We actually already have the first round\n",
      "of employees who are going to be working\n",
      "[3:25] at Arsenal.\n",
      "We brought them from Ohio to HQ.\n",
      "[3:28] They're going to be here for the next\n",

      "[3:31] I guess it's it's less than six months\n",
      "now.\n",
      "[3:32] They've been here for a while and that\n",
      "way they're able to get indoctrinated\n",
      "[3:36] and our processes work on our existing\n",
      "manufacturing systems.\n",
      "[3:39] And then when Arsenal one opens next\n",

      "[3:44] What do you need from the Department of\n",

      "[4:14] longer working on national security\n",
      "problems, but is working on things like\n",
      "[4:17] advertising optimization, on new apps,\n",
      "on on tools of entertainment rather than\n",
      "[4:21] tools of deterrence.\n",
      "And I've seen that reversing.\n",
      "[4:24] There's a lot of people and I'm of all\n",

      "[4:28] in the industry for 20, 30 years, all\n",
      "the way down to kids who are just going\n",
      "[4:31] into school, learning disciplines that\n",
      "are relevant to aerospace and defense.\n",
      "[4:35] I think that there's a lot of people who\n",
      "are realizing we've been resting on our\n",
      "[4:38] laurels and coasting for a couple of\n",
      "decades, and then our tech industry has\n",
      "[4:41] to get in gear and work on more\n",
      "important problems.\n",
      "[4:44] There was a report about the NGC two\n",

      "[4:51] Palantir.\n",
      "We've asked Palantir through Shon to\n",

      "[4:59] Could you just.\n",
      "Respond to that reporting which came\n",
      "[5:01] from Reuters and explain the sort of\n",

      "[5:08] feel there are in that report.\n",
      "So you may or may not remember this, but\n",

      "[5:21] So I care a lot about this stuff, both\n",
      "as a internal perspective and then also\n",
      "[5:24] just from a journalist perspective.\n",
      "The journalist who wrote that Reuters\n",
      "[5:27] story would have been failed out of the\n",
      "class by any of my professors.\n",
      "[5:30] He refused to include our on the record\n",
      "statement.\n",
      "[5:33] He refused to include the on the record\n",
      "statement from the Army because they\n",
      "[5:35] fundamentally made the whole story, not\n",
      "a story.\n",
      "[5:39] There was an analysis saying, hey,\n",
      "there's all of these security problems\n",
      "[5:41] like the system, the prototype for NGC\n",
      "two next generation command control.\n",

      "[5:47] It doesn't have any passwords to log in.\n",
      "There's no security turned on.\n",
      "[5:51] And they said, oh, my God, this is a\n",
      "huge problem.\n",
      "[5:53] And we said, Guys, this was an early\n",
      "prototype.\n",
      "[5:55] The Army wasn't paying us to demonstrate\n",
      "user accounts.\n",
      "[5:58] It was paying us to demonstrate\n",
      "integration of different sensors,\n",
      "[6:01] different weapons systems all into one\n",
      "pipeline.\n",
      "[6:04] And Lattice has all this functionality.\n",

      "[6:07] It's not like it's not like we don't\n",
      "know how to do this.\n",
      "[6:10] And the army said the same.\n",
      "They said, Yeah, we just turned on all\n",
      "[6:12] those features with just a few weeks\n",
      "later, all these issues that you're\n",
      "[6:15] talking about didn't exist.\n",
      "This was an internal security audit,\n",

      "[6:23] Yes.\n",
      "There's no access control.\n",
      "[6:25] Yes, that is a risk.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "[6:26] We have not audited all of their\n",
      "security, you know, all their security\n",
      "[6:29] code.\n",
      "That is a risk.\n",
      "[6:30] But that's completely normal for early,\n",
      "early development.\n",
      "[6:33] But Reuters didn't include our quote,\n",
      "didn't include the Army's quote, because\n",
      "[6:35] that would have made the entire story\n",
      "around it.\n",
      "[6:37] So instead, they include, quote,\n",
      "exclusively from our competitors and\n",
      "[6:40] from so-called anonymous sources saying\n",
